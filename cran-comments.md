### Note
* A change in the email addresses of four of the package authors including the maintainer have been made. This is due to implementation of a unified communications platform by our parent organization (ICAR) warranting a close down of our within institute (ICAR-NBPGR) mail server. A confirmation of this has been sent from the previous address of the maintainer (aravindj@nbpgr.ernet.in).
