#' 'Double Metaphone' phonetic algorithm
#'
#' \code{DoubleMetaphone} converts strings to double metaphone phonetic codes.
#'
#' An implementation of the Double Metaphone phonetic algorithm in \code{R}. If
#' non-ASCII characters encountered in the input character vector \code{str}, a
#' warning is issued and they are transliterated so that the accented characters
#' are converted to their ASCII unaccented versions.
#'
#' @param str A character vector whose strings are to be encoded by double
#'   metaphone algorithm.
#' @return Returns a list with two character vectors of the same length as the
#'   input vector. The first character vector contains the primary double
#'   metaphone encodings, while the second character vector contains the
#'   alternate encodings.

#'   algorithm was adapted from Maurice Aubrey's perl module hosted at the
